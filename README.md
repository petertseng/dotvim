# .vim

This is my vim configuration.
I post it not because I think random internet people care deeply about my particular vim configuration but just so that it's easy for me to access my own vim configuration in various places.

## Plugin management

I use pathogen and submodules.
Works fine for me.
Some people say it is good to know precisely what versions of the submodules you're getting.
Update submodules with:

    git submodule foreach git pull
